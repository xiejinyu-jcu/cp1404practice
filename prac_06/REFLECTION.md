# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?
I write code by hand more often than I understand it. I used to review or preview the content after or before each class, 
but I just studied and understood it, and didnâ€™t really practice it.
Now I will rewrite it on the computer to deepen my understanding of the code.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?
I think I should do more practise in my code and spend a lot of time reviewing, because in each task , It took me a very long time to complete it.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I will develop the habit of reviewing before class and reviewing promptly after class, especially for quizzes.


## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
Delaying problems and mistakes, when I face the issue or mistakes, not immediately solve but rather to wait for the free time then to solve.


## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
I hope that each stage includes a review lesson to help us consolidate our knowledge.
